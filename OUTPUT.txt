⏺ I'll help you find the best way to search the web for LLM consumption. Let me first understand your project context.

⏺ Now I understand the project context - it's focused on building AI agents using TypeScript/Node.js with Gemini. Let me ask a few
  discriminating questions to narrow down the best web search solution for LLM consumption.
                                                                                  
⏺ User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · What's the primary use case for web search in your agent? → Code/API lookup
     · How much control do you need over the search results? → Just works
     · What's your budget tolerance for search API costs? → Free/minimal

     use_when:
       - Building AI agents that need to search for code examples, API docs, or technical content
       - Need LLM-ready search results without building a scraping pipeline
       - Want a single API call that searches AND extracts relevant content

⏺ Research Complete

  I've written a comprehensive report at reports/2025-11-28-web-search-api-for-llm.md.

  Recommendation: Tavily (@tavily/core)

  Why Tavily for your use case:

  | Criteria      | Tavily                                  | Serper                       |
  |---------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
  | Simplicity    | Single call: search + extract           | Requires separate scraping   |
  | LLM-optimized | Returns clean content ready for context | Returns only titles/snippets |
  | Free tier     | 1,000 credits/month                     | 2,500 searches/month         |
  | Setup         | npm i @tavily/core, one API key         | Same                         |

  Quick Start

  import { tavily } from "@tavily/core";

  const tvly = tavily({ apiKey: process.env.TAVILY_API_KEY });

  // Search for code/docs - one call does everything
  const response = await tvly.search("TypeScript zod validation examples", {
    searchDepth: "basic",
    maxResults: 5,
    includeAnswer: "basic", // Optional: LLM-generated summary
  });

  // Results include actual page content, not just snippets
  console.log(response.answer); // Quick summary
  console.log(response.results[0].content); // Extracted content

  When to use Serper instead

  Use Serper ($0.001/search, 2,500 free) if you need:
  - Raw Google SERP features (knowledge graph, People Also Ask, shopping)
  - Image, Maps, Scholar, or Shopping search
  - Higher volume at lower cost

  The report includes integration patterns with your Gemini agent, anti-patterns to avoid, and a complete alternative section for
  Serper when you need raw Google data.
