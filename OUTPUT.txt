> /research is running… the most modern and clean way to setup a typescript project in november 2025 when you are using mise for 
environment management, I want it to be as simple as possible 

⏺ I'll help you find the best way to set up a modern, simple TypeScript project with mise. Let me first examine your current project
  context.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/{package.json,tsconfig.json,.mise.toml,mise.toml,.tool-versions}")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(ls -la)

⏺ Good, I can see you already have mise set up with Node.js. Now let me ask you a few discriminating questions to narrow down the
  best recommendation:

  Questions to Guide the Recommendation

  1. What's the target runtime?
    - Node.js only (CLI tools, backend services, scripts)
    - Browser/bundled (frontend, library to be bundled)
    - Both (isomorphic/full-stack)
  2. What's the primary use case?
    - Quick scripts/utilities (minimal config, just want to run .ts files)
    - Library/package (will publish to npm, needs proper build output)
    - Application (backend API, CLI tool with dependencies)
  3. Testing and tooling preferences?
    - Minimal (just TypeScript execution, I'll add testing later if needed)
    - Batteries included (want testing, linting, formatting set up from the start)

> we are going to build a cli coding agent and want testing 

⏺ Got it! A CLI coding agent in TypeScript with testing. Let me research the current best practices for late 2025.

⏺ Research Complete

  I've written the report to reports/2025-11-28-typescript-project-setup.md.

  Recommendation: tsx + Vitest

  The simplest modern setup for a CLI coding agent:

  | Tool   | Purpose             | Why                                                                         |
  |--------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | tsx    | Run TypeScript      | Zero-config, instant execution, 11.6k GitHub stars                          |
  | Vitest | Testing             | Native TS support, Jest-compatible API, 15.4k stars, 18.5M weekly downloads |
  | tsc    | Type checking       | Run separately in CI/pre-commit                                             |
  | mise   | Tasks + environment | Already have it, replaces npm scripts                                       |

  Quick Start

  npm init -y
  npm install -D typescript tsx vitest @types/node

  Update mise.toml:
  [env]
  _.path = ["./node_modules/.bin"]

  [tools]
  node = "22"

  [tasks.dev]
  run = "tsx watch src/index.ts"

  [tasks.test]
  run = "vitest"

  [tasks.typecheck]
  run = "tsc --noEmit"

  Why not Node.js native TypeScript?

  While Node 22+ supports TypeScript natively via type stripping, it has limitations: no enums without extra flags, no tsconfig
  features like path aliases, and it's still experimental for production. tsx "just works" with zero config.
